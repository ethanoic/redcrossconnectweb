                            <div>
                            <p>Whether you walk in off the street or make an appointment, the blood donation process can be broadly separated into 6 simple steps:<br><br>
                            <b>1) Questionnaire </b><br>
                            You will be asked to complete a short health assessment questionnaire.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>2) Registration </b><br>
                            For registration, you will require a proof of identity, an address and a telephone number that will remain valid for the next 6 months.<br><br>

                            <b>3) Medical screening</b><br>
                            A trained medical screener will ask you about your medical, social and travel history to confirm that you are fit to make a blood donation.<br>
                            We will then proceed to measure and make records of your weight, blood pressure, pulseand body temperature.<br><br>

                            <b>4) Blood test</b><br><br>
                            Your blood haemoglobin level will be checked to ensure that you are suitable for a blood donation.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>5) Blood donation</b><br><br>
                            A small area of your inner forearm will be cleaned and a local painkiller will be administered to ensure that the donation process is pain-free.<br><br>


                            <span>6) Refreshments</span><br>
                            After the donation, you are required to rest for up to 10 minutes on the donation chair. <br><br>
                            It's also a good idea to have some light refreshments before resuming normal activities. <br><br>

                                <p>Make sure you have a good night’s rest. You must not fast the night before. You should have a light meal and drink about 500ml of water 2 to 3 hours before your donation.<br><br>

                            Should you feel unwell on the day of donation, take a rest and consider postponing the donation until you feel better.

                            <p>For the well-being of all blood donors, the nurse will ask them to rest on the donation chair for 10 minutes after the blood donation.<br><br>

                            You must drink at least 500ml of water within the next 3 hours to compensate for blood volume loss. There is no need for you to increase your food intake after blood donation to compensate for blood volume loss.<br><br>

                            You should avoid strenuous exercise after a blood donation. Your athletic performance might be slightly impaired for the next 3 days.<br>

                            <p>Thank you for your support of the National Blood Programme; we are glad to know that you have chosen to start donating blood at 16.<br>
                            However, it is compulsory for anyone below age 18 to submit a signed parental consent form to register for a blood donation.

                                <p>Yes. However, you are required to have a permanent Singapore residential address that’s valid for at least 6 months. Likewise, a valid contact number is also required, so we can contact you in case of an emergency or in the event that clarifications are required.</p>

                            <div>
                            <p>An average adult body contains between 4 and 6 litres of blood (about 7% of our body weight). We collect 350ml from those who weigh between 45kg to 50kg and 450ml from anyone weighing above 50kg.

                            <div>
                                <p>Consult your family doctor to exclude any underlying health problems. You should also consume food with higher iron levels such as beef, liver, raisins, lentils and cashew nuts or dark green leafy vegetables. <br><br>

                                Eat vitamin C rich food together with iron-rich food. Vitamin C increases absorption of iron by the body.<br><br>

                                Avoid drinking tea, coffee and other caffeine-rich drinks one hour before and after food. Caffeine reduces the absorption of iron by the body by more than 80%<br><br>

                                Eating dairy food with iron-rich food can also hinder iron absorption.  As such, you may want to avoid these foods close to the date of donation.<br><br>

                            <label>I’m a vegetarian and have a low blood haemoglobin count. What should I eat to increase my blood haemoglobin level?</label>
                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    Vegetarians have a few ways to increase their blood haemoglobin count.<br><br>

                                    Certain vegetables contain high levels. These include lentils, pumpkin seeds and green leafy vegetables.<br><br>

                                    However, stay away from spinach. Spinach contains oxalic acid (which gives spinach its biting taste) that inhibits the body’s absorption of iron. So while spinach may be rich in iron, much of the iron will not be absorbed. <br><br>

                                    Consider iron supplements one week before the scheduled date of donation to boost your haemoglobin count.<br><br>

                                    However, if you do develop a fever, please wait at least 3 weeks after full recovery before donating.

                                    Your blood type will be tested along with the screening of the blood for infectious diseases. A blood donor card with your blood type will be issued after your second donation.

                    <h2>PLATELET DONATIONS</h2>
                    <ul class="faqlist">
                        <li>
                            <label>What is apheresis? Is blood donation different from platelet donation? Can I donate blood and platelet together? What is the waiting period? Who benefits from blood and platelet? How long does it take?</label>
                            <div>
                                <p>Apheresis is a process whereby only plasma or platelet, or both, are extracted from whole blood. The rest of the blood is returned back to the donor. <br>

                                The amount of platelet or plasma collected through apheresis is about 6 times of that collected from whole blood donation. Since there is hardly any loss of red blood cells and haemoglobin, apheresis donation can be done every 4 weeks, compared to 12 weeks for whole blood donation.<br>

                                You can't donate whole blood and platelets together. If you alternate between whole blood donation and apheresis donation, you can refer to the required interval at
                                <a href="http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/hsaportal/en/health_services/blood_donation/can_i_donate/donation_interval.html">http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/hsaportal/en/health_services/blood_donation/can_i_donate/donation_interval.html</a> <br>

                                Whole blood can be processed into red blood cells, platelets and plasma, or be used whole. <br>

                                Whole blood and red blood cells are used for surgery mitigating the loss of blood and anaemia. Platelet is used for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, as well as patients with low platelet count due to malaria. Plasma is used for burn patients.<br>

                                Apheresis donations will take about 45- 90 minutes.</p>

                        </li>

                            <label>What are the requirements to switch from whole blood donation to apheresis donation?</label>
                            <div>
                                <p>There are two types of apheresis donation, namely plateletpheresis and plasmapheresis. You need to have a prominent and thick vein on at least one arm, weigh at least 50kg and be at least 18 years old. For plateletpheresis, preferred donors are from the O+, A+ and B+ blood types. For plasmapheresis, preferred donors are from AB+ blood type.<br>

                                If you pass the test, you can book future platelet appointments by informing the reception counter in the main hall. Otherwise, you can only book whole blood appointments through the Internet.<br>

                                You can still donate whole blood in the future. After donating platelets, you can donate whole blood or platelets after 4 weeks. However, after you donate whole blood, you can only donate platelets after 12 weeks except for your first platelet donation. You can donate platelets 2 weeks after whole blood donation if it is your first time donating platelets. If you stick to platelet donation, you can donate platelets every 4 weeks.<br>

                                You can also ask the nurse for your platelet count. If your platelet count is too low, you will be asked not to donate platelets.</p>

                    <h2>BLOOD SAFETY</h2>
                    <ul class="faqlist">
                        <li>
                            <label>How do you make sure the blood is safe for patients?</label>
                            <div>
                                <p>The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) aims to supply the safest possible blood to all patients who need a blood transfusion. All donated blood collected is therefore sent for processing and testing at the HSA's laboratories before it is transfused to patients. <br>
                                These are the key processes and tests performed on all donated blood:</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li><strong>Blood component processing:</strong> To optimise blood usage and to benefit more patients, every pack of blood collected is processed into different components, e.g. red blood cells, platelets and fresh frozen plasma. Each of these components can then be given to different patients with different medical needs. </li>
                                  <li><strong>Infectious diseases testing: </strong> Some diseases can be transmitted through blood transfusion. This means that patients receiving blood from donors with certain health conditions may become infected. All donated blood is, therefore, screened for infectious diseases such as HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis. Selected components or units may also be tested for malaria or bacterial contamination. </li>
                                  <li><strong>Blood group testing:</strong> This ensures that the donated blood is given to a patient with a compatible blood type.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Antibody screen:</strong> This ensures there is no high level of abnormal antibodies in donated blood that may be harmful to a patient following a transfusion. </li>
                                  <li><strong>Storage of blood products:</strong>All blood products must be stored under carefully monitored and controlled temperatures and conditions.  This ensures that they are in an optimal state when transfused to patients.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Blood donation is a safe procedure for healthy individuals. <br>

                                Donors give about 8-12% of their circulating blood volume during each blood donation.<br>

                                In general, blood donation does not usually result in significant adverse effects on a donor's health.<br>

                                Healthy donors who meet the required screening criteria should be able to donate blood safely and regularly.</p>

                                <p>There will be a transient reduction in the circulating blood volume equivalent to the blood that you donate. This translates to a mild and momentary weight reduction. However, this fluid deficit will be rapidly and naturally replaced within 72 hours by drinking sufficient water. There is no need for you to increase your food intake after blood donation to compensate for blood volume loss.<br><br>
                                    Weight gain after a blood donation is an urban myth; the only way one can gain weight while donating regularly is through over-snacking or excessive consumption of high-calorie food in the mistaken notion of replacing essential nutrients.

                                  We need a constant supply of safe blood in order to sustain and prepare for emergencies. In Singapore, we aim to maintain sufficient blood stocks for 6 days of usage. <br>

                                  350 units of blood are required daily by hospitals in Singapore for patients requiring blood transfusions.<br>

                                  Furthermore, blood does expire. The shelf life for the different components are as follows:</p>
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>Packed red cells – 42 days</li>
